Well, this time it was Teen Vogue writer Lauren Duca doing the humiliating.During an appearance on Fox News on Friday, Duca refused to let Carlson talk over her and misrepresent what she has said.Earlier this week, a man confronted Ivanka Trump on a JetBlue flight and yelled at her. The man was removed from the plane and Trump supporters immediately threw a hissy fit because someone dared criticize Trump s daughter in public.Despite conservative whining, a majority of people sided with Ivanka in the moment because it s pretty damn rude to approach someone, especially a mother who is with her kids, and yell at them.Duca is also against yelling on airplanes but warned people not to let Ivanka off the hook because of this rude incident.Ivanka Trump is poised to become the most powerful woman in the world. Don t let her off the hook because she looks like she smells good.  Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 23, 2016And, of course, Fox host Tucker Carlson took that tweet the wrong way.He accused Duca of supporting what the man did to Ivanka, but that s not what she said at all and let Carlson know it.Duca conceded that many of Ivanka Trump s qualities are admirable but the fact that she enable her racist sexist father despite appearing to be a feminist is concerning.Tucker Carlson was unable to grasp what Duca was calmly explaining to him. Apparently, she needed to speak more slowly.But the interview grew more contentious as Carlson acted smug and repeatedly tried to prevent Duca from speaking to defend herself, causing her to refer to him as a  partisan hack. Carlson even repeatedly focused on Ivanka being accosted on the plane, which forced Duca to once again explain to Carlson that she is firmly against yelling at people on planes.Once that issue was settled, Carlson moved on to mocking Duca for being a writer at Teen Vogue. That didn t go down so well for Carlson either.And once he finally stopped being an asshole about where Duca works, he attacked her for defending religious freedom, telling her that  she should stick the thigh-high boots  all while laughing at her before cutting her off before she could respond.Here s the video via YouTube.Seriously, Tucker Carlson was rude and out of line and he owes Duca an apology.But Duca responded later on Twitter..@TuckerCarlson is an enemy of rational discourse. In this fraught moment, his bully tactics are profoundly damaging, and achieve nothing.  Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 24, 2016So not only did Duca completely OWN Carlson throughout the interview, Carlson embarrassed himself by acting like a douchebag.Featured image via screenshot\",\n          \"We already know Donald Trump is conceited, but now he might be bringing his fragile ego and worrisome habits to a whole new level.With the Inauguration only days away, many people are working diligently to prepare the nation s Capitol for the event. This includes, but is not limited to, getting all the port-a-potties in their designated locations.Well, one passerby caught something on camera and posted it to Twitter. The image was of a worker taking blue painter s tape and putting it over the name of the port-a-potty company. The name of the company?  Don s Johns.  A Washington DC staple if you ve been to any event there, and was even at President Obama s inaugurations.Here s an image of the name of the company being covered:All the port-a-johns at the Capitol are having the \\\"Don\\\" in Don's Johns taped over. I guess to avoid confusion. pic.twitter.com/FD5Jqjw9HO  Tim Krepp (@timkrepp) January 13, 2017According to The Associated Press: Workers preparing for the inauguration Jan. 20 have taped over the name of the company    Don s Johns    that has long supplied portable restrooms for major outdoor events in the nation s capital.Virginia-based Don s Johns calls itself the Washington area s top provider of portable toilet rentals. But the name apparently strikes too close to home for organizers of the inauguration of Donald John Trump.Workers have placed blue tape over the company name on dozens of portable restrooms installed near the Capitol for the inauguration. That s right, it looks as though, but hasn t been confirmed, that Trump is covering up the name of the port-a-potty because it bears a striking resemblance to his name. And heaven forbid a port-a-potty on Inauguration Day bear the name of the new POTUS.The funniest part of all this? It s kind of obvious and now more attention has been brought to the company name. No one was likely to notice, and now everyone will. Well done, Trump.Featured Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images\",\n          \"In the documents, an unnamed person interviewed by the FBI said Kennedy contacted the FBI to ask for the change in classification in  exchange for a  quid pro quo.'

The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
